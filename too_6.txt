       _C_o_w_s_a_y generates an ASCII picture of a cow saying something provided by
       the  user.   If run with no arguments, it accepts standard input, word-
       wraps the message given at about 40 columns, and prints the cow  saying
       the given message on standard output.

       To  aid in the use of arbitrary messages with arbitrary whitespace, use
       the --nn option.  If it is specified, the given message will not be word-
       wrapped.   This is possibly useful if you want to make the cow think or
       speak in figlet(6).  If --nn is specified, there must not be any command-
       line arguments left after all the switches have been processed.

       The  --WW  specifies  roughly  (where the message should be wrapped.  The
       default is equivalent to --WW 4400 i.e. wrap words at or  before  the  40th
       column.

       If  any  command-line  arguments  are left over after all switches have
       been processed, they become the cow's message.  The  program  will  not
       accept standard input for a message in this case.

       There are several provided modes which change the appearance of the cow
       depending on its particular emotional/physical state.   The  --bb  option
       initiates  Borg  mode;  --dd  causes  the  cow to appear dead; --gg invokes
       greedy mode; --pp causes a state of paranoia to come  over  the  cow;  --ss
       makes  the  cow  appear thoroughly stoned; --tt yields a tired cow; --ww is
       somewhat the opposite of --tt, and initiates wired mode; --yy brings on the
       cow's youthful appearance.

       The  user  may  specify  the  --ee option to select the appearance of the
       cow's eyes, in which case the first  two  characters  of  the  argument
       string _e_y_e___s_t_r_i_n_g will be used.  The default eyes are 'oo'.  The tongue
       is similarly configurable through --TT and _t_o_n_g_u_e___s_t_r_i_n_g; it must be  two
       characters  and does not appear by default.  However, it does appear in
       the 'dead' and 'stoned' modes.  Any configuration done  by  --ee  and  --TT
       will be lost if one of the provided modes is used.

       The  --ff option specifies a particular cow picture file (''cowfile'') to
       use.  If the cowfile spec contains '/' then it will be interpreted as a
       path  relative to the current directory.  Otherwise, cowsay will search
       the path specified in the CCOOWWPPAATTHH environment variable.   To  list  all
       cowfiles on the current CCOOWWPPAATTHH, invoke ccoowwssaayy with the --ll switch.

       If  the program is invoked as ccoowwtthhiinnkk then the cow will think its mes-
       sage instead of saying it.


CCOOWWFFIILLEE FFOORRMMAATT
       A cowfile is made up of a simple block of ppeerrll(1) code, which assigns a
       picture  of  a  cow  to the variable $$tthhee__ccooww.  Should you wish to cus-
       tomize the eyes or the tongue of the cow, then the variables $$eeyyeess  and
       $$ttoonngguuee may be used.  The trail leading up to the cow's message balloon
       is composed of the character(s) in the $$tthhoouugghhttss variable.   Any  back-
       slashes  must  be reduplicated to prevent interpolation.  The name of a
       cowfile should end with ..ccooww, otherwise it is assumed not to be a  cow-
       file.   Also, at-signs (''@'') must be backslashed because that is what
       Perl 5 expects.

       What older versions? :-)

       Version 3.x is fully backward-compatible with 2.x versions.  If  you're
       still  using  a 1.x version, consider upgrading.  And tell me where you
       got the older versions, since I didn't exactly put them up  for  world-
       wide access.

       Oh,  just  so  you  know,  this  manual  page documents version 3.02 of
       cowsay.

       The COWPATH environment variable, if present, will be  used  to  search
       for  cowfiles.  It contains a colon-separated list of directories, much
       like PPAATTHH oorr MMAANNPPAATTHH.  It should always contain  the  //uussrr//sshhaarree//ccoowwssaayy
       directory,  or  at  least a directory with a file called ddeeffaauulltt..ccooww in
       it.

FFIILLEESS
       //uussrr//sshhaarree//ccoowwssaayy holds a sample set of cowfiles.  If your  CCOOWWPPAATTHH  is
       not explicitly set, it automatically contains this directory.
